This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Nothing is here!

Right now this is just an excuse project for learning NextJS.

To do in the Booty lists:
- Jewelry: weapons and armor tables
- PersonalItem: specialty kit, trade goods
- Rarity: weapons / armor, magic items 
- MagicItems:
    - skipping enchantment scope & value.

UI:
- it'd be nice to add a component with a drop down for all functions available and maybe a count for how many to roll up.
