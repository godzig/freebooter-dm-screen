This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Freebooter Booty Generator

Mostly this was an excuse to playing with NextJS.

Some other features I was thinking about.
- make "add magic" a toggle to give plain things cool magic names.
- elaborate MagicItem enchantments
