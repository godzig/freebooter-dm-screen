This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Nothing is here!

Right now this is just an excuse project for learning NextJS.

- Pull booty die, table dropdown, reroll, and count into a unified menu bar.
- How to do MagicItem enchantments?
- make "add magic" a toggle to give plain things cool magic names.
- probably item values should become an object so I can pass them around and total and stats and stuff.
