This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Right now this is just an excuse project for learning NextJS.

To do in the Booty lists:
- Jewelry: weapons and armor tables
- PersonalItem: specialty kit, trade goods
- Rarity: weapons / armor
- Rarity is unfinished...
